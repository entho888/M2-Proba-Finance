# M2 Proba Finance

<p> Packages : numpy, matplotlib, scipy </p>
<p> Extensions : ms-python, autoDocstring </p>

The goal is to implement things I see in my courses : pricing derivatives, simulation of some random variables, brownian motion simulation, statistical estimation. It will be a mix between I do things that already exists in python librairies or I use what's already existing and implement more complex algorithms (that certainly already exists, but it's for the training).
